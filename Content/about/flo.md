## Career 👩🏻‍💻
#### Flo Health 🦩
<br />
Previously, I worked at <a href="https://flo.health/" target="_blank" style="color:#0a84ff; text-decoration: none;">Flo Health</a> - **the number one women's health app** in both the Android and Apple app stores with 100 million installs and 30 million monthly active users.<br /><br />
At Flo, I grew up as a person and a professional, made some good friends, and tried myself in lots of opportunities when finally decided to move on to the next big thing 🚀
